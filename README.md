## Overview

### The challenge

I built this project to learn CSS Grid, so the challenge was to position images properly on all devices according to my design in Figma. It was rebuilt after I completed Conquering Responsive Layouts Challenge (by Kevin Powell) to adhere to best practices in organising code, as for my understanding so far :)
